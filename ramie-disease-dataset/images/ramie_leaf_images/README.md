## Image Quality Notes

**Important Disclaimer**: Due to the limited availability of ramie-specific disease images in public databases, some images in this collection may show similar diseases on related plant species rather than exclusively ramie (Boehmeria nivea). These images have been selected to represent the characteristic symptoms of each disease type and can serve as reference material for disease identification and machine learning training purposes.

### Image Selection Criteria
- Clear disease symptoms visible on leaves
- Field photographs (not laboratory or microscopic images)
- Minimal watermarks (only in margins where present)
- Resolution >500x500 pixels (suitable for ML training)
- Single leaf or plant focus (avoiding multi-panel composite figures)

### Limitations
- Some images may show diseases on plants other than ramie
- Ramie-specific disease images are rare in public databases
- Images sourced from various agricultural extension services and research publications
- Disease symptoms can vary based on environmental conditions and disease stage

## Usage Recommendations

These images are intended for:
- Plant disease identification training
- Machine learning model development
- Educational and research purposes
- Comparative disease symptom analysis

For production ML models, it is recommended to supplement this collection with:
- Additional ramie-specific field photographs
- Images from local ramie growing regions
- Verified disease samples from agricultural research stations
- Multiple growth stages and severity levels of each disease
